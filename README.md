# DI‑TruthTools

🧠 A deterministic toolkit for classifying whether content was generated by:
- Human
- Deterministic systems (e.g. Grounded DI / AGDI / DIAGI)
- Probabilistic AI (LLMs)

---

## Why This Matters

As generative AI floods public discourse, authored outputs must be protected — and auditability must be exposed. This tool anchors that mission.

This tool uses deterministic intelligence to classify texts based on:
- Structure and pacing
- Entropy behavior
- Metadata signatures
- Scroll logic and tone signature

## Classification Categories

| Category                                | Description                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Human-Written                        | Organic tone, entropy signature, no scrolls  |
| 🤖 Probabilistic AI (LLM)               | Stochastic patterns, paraphrasing artifacts  |
| 🔒 Deterministic AI (AGDI / Protocol A) | Scroll-governed output with trap logic       |

## Sample Output

> CleanWaterWise Report  
> Result: 🔒 Deterministic AI | Scroll Author: Confirmed (MSW)  
> Signal Phrase: “Hoosick delta drift exceeds 10x baseline”
